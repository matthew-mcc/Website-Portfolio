# Coding Projects Portfolio Website / Blog
This project is a full stack website designed using Django and HTML. It is a simple Blog style website that is currently only hosted on the host machine by running it locally. All backend connections, authentication, ports, models and communications were written in Django, and the front-end web pages are created using basic HTML. The entirety of the project was created and enclosed in a Python virtual environment.

# Software / libraries used:
- Python 3.9
- Django
- HTML
# ___USAGE___
To set up the website:
1. Create a virtual enviroment on your local machine.
2. Clone this repository into the new virtual environment.
3. Navigate to the venv/Scripts folder and run "activate.bat" to launch the website.
4. From there connect to local host in your browser.


# Versions:
This program is still very much a work in progress and is currently in Alpha 1.0.

# Further implementation
There are many possible implementation ideas as this is a work in progress:
- More pages.
- Better design in HTML - possibly selecting another language like typescript.
- Host this website on a webserver.
- Connect it with GitHub to connect all my projects in one place.
- Register under my own personal domain.
