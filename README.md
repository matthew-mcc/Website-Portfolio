# Website-Portfolio

WORK IN PROGRESS website / portfolio. This project was created in python and uses the Django and Flask frameworks for creating these elements. There is also some HTML for front-end UI.

This website was made in a virtual environment and is self sufficient in the folder. 
Currently only accessible from a local website - it is not hosted on any web based server right now.

I plan to update this to be my professional portfolio website, but for now it showcases website development both back-end and front-end.

# Usage

Run the activate.bat file located in the venv to get the virtual machine running. From there it is pretty self explanatory. This is not really meant to be ran as again, it is still a work in progress.
